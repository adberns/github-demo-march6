# March 6 Demo
This is part of my README that I used for the March 6 GitHub demo.

A pretty standard workflow if you're working by yourself would be:
* make edits to the files and folders inside your repository's directory
* commit whenever you reach a good stopping point (as defined by you)
* push to send your changes to the server/remote repository
* pull to get updated changes from the remote repository when you are working on a different machine (or the same one)

* I'll make another edit that we'll remove here
